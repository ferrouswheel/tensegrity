# Log of Tensegrity Build Progress

## 18-10-2014 - Joel

First! Took the Processing sketch and made it possible to update
the colors on each led for a better idea of the visual effect. Will
decouple the pattern code so can hopefully easily port it to another
framework/language.

Updated various google docs.

I am somewhat set on making the original Tensegrity design.

I have obtained an AC drive controller and motor from Trademe. Hopefully
P will help me get them connected in the next couple of weeks.
