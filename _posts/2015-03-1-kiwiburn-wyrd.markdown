Peter Jennings probably got the best photos of the structure while it was at
Kiwiburn:

## Conclusion

The original vision was a 3m high cylinder that could spin itself on a pole that was also 3m high for a structure with a total height of 6m. Instead, Tensegrity was a 3m high cylinder inside a 2.4x2.4x4m scaffold box and invited the observer to spin the cylinder by hand. Ultimately, I think this worked better. Seeing people spin it by hand, while others watched from afar had a great community aspect. While spinning it was fun, one could only really appreciate the visual aesthetic from afar.

All the videos we took, including some timelapses are available in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRbkixbU0Njz_jmT5p5If9KAZ3-cTVpu9">Youtube playlist</a>. If you got additional photos or videos, we'd love to see them.

We've submitted Tensegrity to some future light festivals around New Zealand, so will announce here if those are accepted.

## Acknowledgements

Beyond Patrick and Felicia who put in as much sweat (and blood!) into this art as I did, I’d like to thank the following people for helping make this crazy idea reality:

- Wendy Allison, for believing I could do it and not minding the noise of grinding metal, sparks, and circuit breakers popping.
- Andrea Knox, Nicola Treloar, Albert Hopley, Tobias - for helping set up and tear down the art work at Kiwiburn.
- Kiwiburn Art Grant Committee for their contribution and entrusting me to bring the concept to reality.
- The local Fish and Chip shop, for refueling us at the end of a day in the sun working with metal.
