Here I am welding on the tags for attaching the middle layer of struts.

After cutting things to length, we still needed to trim the struts to fit due to the variability of tags and wanting to keep the angular distance between bolt holes equal.

Fitting the middle layer of struts which go in the opposite direction to the inner and outer layers. This is where it starts getting tricky to remember the angle of things and to avoid getting tangled up.

The tags on the arms are each angled to match the direction of the struts at that particular layer.

All the bits collapse to not much space, quite good for storage and transport of an art work that takes so much volumetric space when assembled!

Now it was time to clean up the welds before painting the pipes.

At this stage I was really yearning for a workshop with vices and bench space. "Ow, mah back!"

All the braces hanging in the garage and undercoated. The rest of the pipes were more annoying to paint due to the their long curvy nature, and due to 4 solid days of typical Wellington wind (read: a freaking gale).

But after things were painted, it was worth the effort. Nice matt black finish :-)

I still needed to weld on some fastening points to the axle, for electronics and 4x 20A 5V Meanwell PSUs. And yup, my welding has a lot of improvement to go.

Due to miscalculation when picking up the tubing, things were cut too short. We had to extend the pipe slightly. Another tricky weld requiring things to stay straight which Patrick did.
